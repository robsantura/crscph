# Welcome

The **Center for Systems Change and Social Norms Research in Public Health** is dedicated to advancing research and practice that transform the systems, structures, and cultural norms shaping health outcomes. We work at the intersection of **public health, social norms, systems science, and health equity**, bringing together research, community insight, and policy analysis to support meaningful and sustainable change.

Our logo reflects this mission—demonstrating the interdependence between systems, community, and culture, and the shared responsibility required to improve public health for all.

## What We Do

At the Center, we focus on research and partnerships that:

- Examine how **social norms** influence behaviors, health outcomes, and equity.
- Identify and address **structural and systems-level drivers** of disparities.
- Develop tools, frameworks, and evidence that support **systems transformation**.
- Collaborate with communities, government agencies, and cross-sector partners.
- Translate research into **practice and policy** to improve population health.

## Our Commitment to Equity

We ground our work in the belief that public health must be:

- **Inclusive**
- **Community-informed**
- **Culturally responsive**
- **Accountable to those most impacted by systemic inequities**

Our research and partnerships reflect these values, prioritizing lived experience alongside empirical evidence.
