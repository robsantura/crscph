# Center for Advanced Research on Social Norms and Systems Change in Public Health

### Advancing evidence-driven insights for stronger, more equitable public health systems

The **Center for Advanced Research on Social Norms and Systems Change in Public Health (CRSC-PH)** generates rigorous, contextually grounded research to illuminate how **social norms**, **leadership practices**, and **system structures** shape public health outcomes.

We partner with communities, institutions, and global public health actors to translate evidence into strategies that foster sustainable and meaningful systems transformation.

CRSC-PH bridges research, policy, and practice to support public health systems that are people-centered, equity-informed, and responsive to real-world complexity.

## What We Do

### Applied Research & Evaluation Consulting

We design and implement mixed-methods research to understand:

-   Social norms and behavior drivers\
-   System-level determinants of health\
-   Governance and political economy dynamics\
-   Program implementation, adaptation, and impact evaluation

Our work includes **baseline and endline assessments**, **social norms diagnostics**, and **evaluations** that inform strategic decision-making.

### Systems Change & Strategic Advisory

CRSC-PH supports organizations, coalitions, and government partners to:

-   Map systems and identify leverage points\
-   Strengthen governance, accountability, and learning\
-   Align leadership, structures, and resources\
-   Develop context-responsive strategies for change

Our systems thinking approach helps partners move from isolated interventions to **coherent, adaptive, and sustainable transformation**.

### Leadership & Capacity Strengthening

We cultivate leadership that is relational, values-driven, and grounded in equity.\
Our offerings include:

-   Leadership coaching and accompaniment\
-   Facilitation and learning spaces\
-   Organizational development and team support

We emphasize trauma-informed, culturally grounded, justice-oriented approaches that honor lived experience and community wisdom.

## Focus Areas of Work

-   **Social Norms & Behavior Change**\
    Understanding empirical and normative expectations, sanctions, and reference groups shaping key health behaviors.

-   **Systems Change & Public Health Governance**\
    Examining how policies, procedures, institutions, power relations, narratives, and mental models shape public health outcomes and equity.

-   **Equity & Structural Determinants of Health**\
    Centering historical and contemporary drivers of inequity, including racism, gender inequality, and socioeconomic marginalization.

-   **Community-Engaged Research & Co-Creation**\
    Conducting research and designing solutions collaboratively with communities, not merely about them.

## Our Approach

CRSC-PH’s work is guided by core commitments:

-   **Contextualized evidence** – Rigorous methods grounded in cultural, political, and historical context.\
-   **Co-creation** – Partnership with communities and stakeholders throughout the research, evaluation, and implementation process.\
-   **Systems thinking** – Attention to relationships, structures, narratives, and patterns of power.\
-   **Dignity and justice** – Centering community agency, healing, and equity in all aspects of our work.

We aim not only to produce findings, but to **support real-world decision-making**, **strengthen local capacity**, and **promote systems that are more just and more effective**.
