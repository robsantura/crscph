    "text": "Our Approach\nMeaningful and lasting public health change requires more than programs. It requires shifting the systems and norms that shape decision-making, resource allocation, and lived experience. CRSCPH takes an integrated, equity-centered approach grounded in four core pillars:\n\nSystems Change\nWe examine and address the policies, structures, and institutional practices that drive health inequities. Our work focuses on identifying leverage points within complex systems and supporting strategies that promote accountability, equity, and long-term transformation.\n\n\nSocial Norms Research\nSocial norms—shared beliefs, expectations, and unwritten rules—play a powerful role in shaping behavior, service access, and health outcomes. CRSCPH applies social norms theory and behavioral science to understand how culture and context influence health, particularly for communities historically marginalized by public systems.\n\n\nEquity and Inclusion\nEquity is not an add-on; it is foundational to our work. We center lived experience as expertise and prioritize community partnership, co-design, and participatory approaches throughout research, evaluation, and implementation. Our work is trauma-informed, culturally responsive, and grounded in respect for community knowledge.\n\n\nTranslating Evidence Into Action\nCRSCPH works alongside communities, agencies, and cross-sector partners to ensure research findings lead to practical solutions. This includes informing policy, improving programs, strengthening systems, and supporting leaders to apply evidence in real-world contexts."
