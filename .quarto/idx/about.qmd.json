Equity. Action.*\n\n**CRSCPH** is a research and practice hub dedicated to advancing health equity by understanding—and transforming—the systems, structures, and social norms that shape population health and social well-being.\n\nPublic health challenges are rarely the result of individual behavior alone. They are produced by policies, institutions, power dynamics, and cultural norms that influence access, opportunity, and outcomes across communities. CRSCPH works at this intersection of research, practice, and policy to support systems-level change that is equitable, sustainable, and community-centered.\n\nWe bring together interdisciplinary research, social science expertise, and public health practice, partnering closely with communities and institutions to translate evidence into meaningful action.\n\n## **Our Mission**\n\nCRSCPH advances health equity and social change by translating research into action through rigorous evaluation, intervention design, social norms research, and leadership development. We partner with communities, organizations, and systems to transform the conditions that shape population health and social well-being.\n\n## **Our Vision**\n\nA future where public health and social systems are just, responsive, and rooted in community wisdom—producing equitable outcomes across generations.\n\n## **Our Approach**\n\nMeaningful and lasting public health change requires more than programs. It requires shifting the systems and norms that shape decision-making, resource allocation, and lived experience. CRSCPH takes an integrated, equity-centered approach grounded in four core pillars:\n\n### **Systems Change**\n\nWe examine and address the policies, structures, and institutional practices that drive health inequities. Our work focuses on identifying leverage points within complex systems and supporting strategies that promote accountability, equity, and long-term transformation.\n\n### **Social Norms Research**\n\nSocial norms—shared beliefs, expectations, and unwritten rules—play a powerful role in shaping behavior, service access, and health outcomes. CRSCPH applies social norms theory and behavioral science to understand how culture and context influence health, particularly for communities historically marginalized by public systems.\n\n### **Equity and Inclusion**\n\nEquity is not an add-on; it is foundational to our work. We center lived experience as expertise and prioritize community partnership, co-design, and participatory approaches throughout research, evaluation, and implementation. Our work is trauma-informed, culturally responsive, and grounded in respect for community knowledge.\n\n### **Translating Evidence Into Action**\n\nCRSCPH works alongside communities, agencies, and cross-sector partners to ensure research findings lead to practical solutions. This includes informing policy, improving programs, strengthening systems, and supporting leaders to apply evidence in real-world contexts.\n\n## **What We Do**\n\nCRSCPH provides consulting and partnership support across three core areas:\n\n**Research, Evaluation, and Learning**\\\nWe design and conduct equity-focused research and evaluation, using mixed methods to measure what matters and support continuous learning and improvement.\n\n**Intervention and Strategy Design**\\\nWe support the development of theory-driven, community-informed interventions and systems-level strategies, including social norms change initiatives and policy-relevant solutions.\n\n**Leadership and Capacity Development**\\\nWe work with leaders and organizations to strengthen equity-centered leadership, support organizational change, and build capacity for systems transformation.\n\n## **What Makes CRSCPH Distinct**\n\n-   We intentionally bridge research and practice, ensuring evidence informs decision-making and action.\n\n-   We integrate systems thinking with social norms theory to address root causes—not just symptoms—of inequity.\n\n-   We prioritize culturally responsive, community-grounded approaches.\n\n-   We focus on structural drivers of health outcomes, not solely individual behavior.\n\n-   We support organizations seeking to reimagine how public health is designed, implemented, and led.\n\n## **Our Work in Action**\n\nCRSCPH collaborates with state and local public health agencies, community-based organizations, academic partners, national research networks, foundations, and policy leaders. Through these partnerships, we support systems transformation, policy development, health equity research, and community-led change initiatives.\n\n## **Connect With Us**\n\nCRSCPH welcomes partnerships, inquiries, and opportunities for collaboration. Whether you are seeking a research partner, evaluation support, or guidance on systems and norms change, we invite you to connect and explore how we can work together.\n\nEmail: robsan.tura\\@crscph.org\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n## **Center for Research on Systems Change in Public Health (CRSCPH)**\n\n### *Evidence.
