# About the Center

The **Center for Systems Change and Social Norms Research in Public Health** is a research and practice hub dedicated to understanding how **systems, structures, and social norms** shape health outcomes—and how transforming them can advance equity and wellbeing for all communities.

We bring together interdisciplinary research, community partnership, and public health practice to illuminate the forces that influence behavior, culture, and policy across populations.

## Our Mission

To strengthen public health systems by generating evidence, tools, and partnerships that shift harmful norms, transform inequitable structures, and support healthier, more inclusive communities.

---

## Our Vision

A world where public health systems are just, responsive, and inclusive—and where social norms uplift rather than marginalize communities.  
A world where **health equity is the standard**, not the exception.

---

## Our Approach

We believe meaningful and sustainable public health change requires a combined focus on:

### **1. Systems Change**
Understanding and transforming the policies, structures, and institutional practices that shape health outcomes and inequities.

### **2. Social Norms Research**
Examining how cultural expectations, beliefs, and unwritten rules influence behavior, service access, and health equity—especially among marginalized communities.

### **3. Equity and Inclusion**
Centering lived experience, co-design, and community voice in all stages of research and implementation.

### **4. Translating Evidence Into Action**
Working with communities, agencies, and cross-sector partners to turn research findings into practical solutions, policy improvements, and systems transformation.
