title: "About CRSC-PH"
---

The **Center for Advanced Research on Social Norms and Systems Change in Public Health (CRSC-PH)** exists to help public health systems become more **effective**, **equitable**, and **responsive to lived realities**.

We focus on the intersection of:

-   **Social norms and behavior**
-   **Systems change and governance**
-   **Leadership and organizational learning**
-   **Equity and structural determinants of health**

Our work is grounded in both **rigorous research** and **deep respect for community wisdom**, recognizing that durable change emerges when evidence, practice, and lived experience are in conversation.

## Our Story

CRSC-PH was founded by **Dr. Robsan Tura**, a public health executive and researcher with years of experience working across community, national, and global levels.

Dr. Tura’s work has focused on:

-   Diagnosing and shifting harmful social norms related to health and wellbeing\
-   Supporting systems change in complex public health environments\
-   Building leadership capacity grounded in equity, humility, and accountability\
-   Bridging research, policy, and practice to reduce disparities

CRSC-PH grew out of a simple conviction:\
\> *Healthy systems require both sound evidence and deep attention to power, narrative, and relationships.*

## How We Work

Our approach is:

-   **Evidence-informed** – We use rigorous designs and methods but avoid “one-size-fits-all” solutions.\
-   **Context-aware** – We attend to history, politics, culture, and identity.\
-   **Collaborative** – We co-design with partners and communities, not just deliver reports.\
-   **Trauma- and equity-informed** – We recognize structural violence, exclusion, and the emotional toll of working in constrained systems.

We see each project as an opportunity to **generate insight**, **strengthen capacity**, and **support healing and transformation**.

## Our Values

-   **Dignity** – Every person and community deserves to be treated with respect and care.\
-   **Justice** – We are committed to addressing structural inequities, not just individual behaviors.\
-   **Integrity** – We prioritize transparency, methodological rigor, and honest learning.\
-   **Solidarity** – We work *with* partners, not over or against them.

CRSC-PH aims to be a thoughtful, reliable partner for those who are serious about making public health systems more just, effective, and people-centered.
